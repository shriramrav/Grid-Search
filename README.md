# Grid-Search
## Description
Grid-Search is a JavaScript-based project that showcases how path-finding/graph-searching algorithms work. The application consists of a large two-dimensional grid where the user can manually select and change the position of the start node, the end node, and obstacle nodes. The user can then choose from a list of algorithms to run on the grid and observe how to algorithm finds a path. Additionally, the website uses ultra-clean CSS animations to enhance the user experience. Indeed, while Grid-Search may predominantly revolve around search algorithms, one of the main focuses was also a clean user interface and experience.
